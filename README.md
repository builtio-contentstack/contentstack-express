## Connect to a Stack
Start building your web application by connecting it to your existing stack.

Navigate to your workspace in the terminal, and run the 'connect' command.

This will prompt you to enter the stack's api key and access token. You can find these details under `Settings > Stack` page.

```bash
Enter your stack api key: {API_KEY}

```
This will validate the stack. Once validated, you will be prompted to enter the project root directory and select one of the publishing environments of your stack.

```bash
Enter the name of the directory to contain the project: (my-site)
Select the publishing environment:
1. development
2. staging
3. production
```
This will automatically configure your project for the selected publishing environment along with basic theme for the website.
